This is the code for Tianxing Zheng's PHY479 undegraduate research program at the University of Toronto in 2024. The scripts zescript_3.py and zescript_4.py are adapted from Eric Hester's code in the paper Aspect ratio affects iceberg melting (2021) [1]. I want to give credits to Professor Nicolas Grisouard and Professor Erica Rosenblum, who initiated the program together and offered a lot of help. I also want to thank Haoyuan Shi, who helped me with the code.

1. The zescript_3.py and zescript_4.py is the main body code for the simulation of ice melting. The former only runs simulation in the first 25 seconds and the latter will run the simulation until only 10% of the ice volume is left. User should run main3_loop.py to execute zescript_3.py, and run main4_loop.py to execute zescript_4.py. 

2. merge.py is just a script that merges the data file generated by zescript_3.py or zescript_4.py. Please do not change it or run it directly.

3. analysis_allT.py generates an animation that shows the change of temperature and velocity field. It also shows the change of ice volume. analysis_c.py animates the change of salinity.

4. The codes in analysis-2024040401 track the change of ice volume, kinetic energy and melting rate throughout the process.
